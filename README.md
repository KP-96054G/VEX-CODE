# 96054G Code
# The main code for our Team can be found within the SRC Folder. The active code can be found in Main.cpp, and the scrapped code can be found in comments.cpp. The Project.pros file contains the name, port, and logo for our project. The static folder contains downloaded paths from path.jerry.io, which were download but not used for this project. In the include foler, prexisting header files api.h and main.h can be found. Selection.h was a head file for Selection.cpp, which was a scrapped auton selector. The rest of the files are unimportant.

# A full explanation of main.cpp can be found by running Read.java or reading "info.txt".
